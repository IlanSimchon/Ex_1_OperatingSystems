This exercise was divided into 4 main part:
1. Work with debugger in which we had to create 2 different bugs (one done by trying to access a location that wasn't set in advance and the other one was an infinite loop). We had to run our code with and without debugger, wait for a core dummped and run the 'gdb' in order to find the exact location of the error.
2. In the second part we had to create a program that receives 3 numbers that represent 3 different lengths of a triangle. The program had scan the lengths, and decide whether or not it is a Pythagorian triangle, if it is the program will calculate the 3 angles and display them, otherwise it would print error.
3.
